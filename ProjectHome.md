CACTI (formerly CTCSU) is based on an LGPL audio player engine developed by Javazoom (http://www.javazoom.net/index.shtml).  CACTI extends this engine into a GUI driven tool used to "code" and study the delivery of MI (Motivational Interviewing).  MI and CACTI were initially developed at the University of New Mexico.

Platform Notes:
CACTI will work on any platform supporting a Sun JVM.  However, it was designed for a specific user group utilizing the Windows XP platform, and the GUI works best on Windows XP utilizing 1024x768 or greater resolution.
