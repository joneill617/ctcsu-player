# Introduction #

Welcome to the new repository for the UNM CASAA CTCSU (CASAA Treatment Coding System Utility).


# Details #

This is the new Google Code site for the CTCSU MISC coding tool.  This project was developed using the Basic Player engine developed under the LGPL by Javazoom.  It has been extended with a GUI interface for use in the study of Motivational Interviewing.

This project is currently seeking a new maintainer to interface with UNM CASAA on the development.
